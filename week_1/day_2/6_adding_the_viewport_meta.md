## Viewport Meta

- Within the `<head>` tags, of your `application.html.erb` in `views/layouts` folder. Add the following line,

  ```
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  ```

- This ensures that your css scaling remains the same across all media widths, without this, mobile users will
view your website scaled extremely small.
