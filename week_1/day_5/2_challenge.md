# Day 5 Lessons

## Challenge

- This may be rather heavy for you today. We're going to practice it now by creating `CommentsController` and all it's associated methods

- Refer to yesterday's lessons and today's (It is principally similar to `Topics and Posts`, now you are just building for `Posts and Comments`)

- Be wary that it is now 2 levels deep for your comments. Be sure to pass in both the id of `topic` and `post` into your urls when creating for `comments`.
