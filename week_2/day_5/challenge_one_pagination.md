# Day 5

## Welcome to your first documentation reading challenge

- You are tasked to build a `pagination` feature for your application. Pagination breaks your `all` query - for example `Topic.all` into smaller chunks to reduce load to the database. Imagine
loading thousands of records with one query `all`. That would slow down your application tremendously, hence it is a good idea to implement pagination to break it down to smaller chunks.

- The gem you will be using is called [kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari)

- Install it, read the documentation - and build the implementation.
